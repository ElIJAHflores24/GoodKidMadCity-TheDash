# GoodKidMadCity-TheDash
Good Kid MAAD City: The DASH is a narrative-driven 2D side-scrolling runner that explores the daily challenges, distractions, and resilience of a young Black teenager navigating life in South Central Los Angeles. The game blends fast-paced platforming with cultural storytelling, asking players to make split-second decisions that mirror real-life pressures.

This project demonstrates how interactive gameplay can communicate themes of focus, discipline, and perseverance while remaining fun and accessible.

🧠 The Vision
The goal of Good Kid MAAD City: The DASH is to create a game that players can relate to, feel represented in, and reflect on. Through Derrick’s journey to school, the game highlights how environment, peer pressure, and everyday decisions influence a young person’s path.

The experience is designed to balance:
Intuitive runner mechanics
Meaningful player choices
Cultural authenticity inspired by LA communities

👤 Protagonist
Derrick is a determined 15-year-old growing up in the heart of the city. With headphones on and a backpack full of dreams, he’s focused on one goal: making it to school.
As Derrick runs through his neighborhood, he must dodge distractions, avoid negative influences, and stay mentally locked in despite constant pressure. Derrick represents resilience, ambition, and the daily hustle of a good kid trying to stay on the right path.

🕹 Core Gameplay
Genre: 2D Side-Scrolling Runner / Platformer
Platform: PC

Perspective: Side view

Structure: Level-based progression

Player Objective
  Complete each level without losing focus
  Progress through all levels to ultimately make it to school

🧠 Focus Bar (Lose Condition)

The core gameplay system is the Focus Bar, which represents Derrick’s mental clarity and determination.
Players lose if the Focus Bar is fully depleted. This happens when:
Picking up negative influence items

Falling off platforms or missing jumps

When the player loses:

They are reset to the current level

Progress is not lost beyond that level

This mechanic reinforces the theme that mistakes don’t end the journey — but they do require refocusing.

🏁 Win Condition

Level Win: Successfully reach the endpoint of a level

Game Win: Complete all levels, representing Derrick successfully making it to school

Each level acts as a chapter in Derrick’s journey to school. 

⭐ Items & Power-Ups

As Derrick dashes through the city, he encounters items that directly affect his Focus Bar.

Item Types:

Positive Items such as basketball and books

Increase the Focus Bar

Represent encouragement, discipline, and positive habits

Negative Items such as skii masks and bandannas

Decrease the Focus Bar

Represent distractions, peer pressure, and harmful influences

Players must quickly decide what to collect and what to avoid, turning moment-to-moment gameplay into meaningful choices.

🧨 Enemies & Obstacles

Rival gang members and environmental hazards appear throughout each level. These obstacles:

Block paths

Force risky jumps

Attempt to pull Derrick off his focus

They symbolize real-world negative influences that test the player’s attention and discipline.

🎮 Controls

Keyboard Only (PC):

W / A / S / D – Movement

Space Bar – Jump

Controls are intentionally simple to keep the focus on reaction time and decision-making.

🎨 Inspiration & Setting

The game is inspired by Los Angeles culture and urban environments, particularly how surroundings can shape youth experiences. Visuals, characters, and level design reflect real neighborhoods, pressures, and attitudes without exaggeration.

The intention is authenticity — not parody.
